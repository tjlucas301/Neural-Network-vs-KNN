Comparing performance of Artificial Neural Network with K Nearest Neighbors classification on dataset containing student study habits, parental education, extracurriculars, etc along with average grade (A, B, C, D, or F) class lables.  Demonstrating how supervised deep learning is much better suited for datasets that contain high nuance and variability within classes compared to unsupervised algorithm such as KNN.  KNN achieved 57% accuracy and NN contained 99+%.  Dataset only contained 2392 instances so overfitting is a possibility if this model was used on a larger and more comprehensive dataset.
